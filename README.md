Fix Me!
======
Hello and welcome to Fix Me! This repository is set up to help determine your level of skill as a Front End Developer (FED). With the skills that you've learned over the course of being the FED that you are today, please try to bring this site up to full working order.

Below are your stories for this short sprint that will help guide you through the process. There are some new features where you can show your creativity and there are some bugs that need fixing!

Thanks for taking the time to fix the site for us and of course, there are many FED's out there with different abilities so don't worry if you can't complete some parts but more importantly, have fun! :D
